<Callout>
  This article is **not** a walk-through or tutorial! I wanted to share some of
  the new Next.js 13 features, Tailwind CSS animations, and custom components
  I'm using on my website this year.
</Callout>

## Introduction

Nearly every year, I redesign (and sometimes rebuild) my website from the ground up. It's a great exercise to practice new things I've learned over the year, refactor any wrong code, and implement new design techniques. I feel more confident with my design skills this year than ever!

Beyond the actual design, I didn't change much about my website. That being said, let's dive right in!

## Next.js 13

The release of [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) has introduced new features that I have enjoyed using, even though it's still in beta. I am utilizing the `appDir` for my page and routing structure and also love the custom TypeScript VSCode plugin Vercel provides to make the developer experience better.

I am also utilizing `@next/font` and `@vercel/analytics` to make use of font optimization and [Vercel's new analytics acquisition](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-acquires-splitbee).

## Next MDX Remote

Next-mdx-remote is a powerful tool that allows developers to use MDX files in their Next.js projects. MDX files are a combination of Markdown and JSX, which allows developers to easily create rich, interactive content. Here are some important benefits of using next-mdx-remote:

- Easily import your content as data
- Use JS/TS â€” no new query language to learn
- Strong-typed data with auto-generated type definitions
- Built-in and configurable content validations
- Detailed error messages
- Fast build and page performance
- Improved SEO

The first tool I used that also follows the concept of structured content, or thinking of content as data, was [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/structured-content), which I enjoy using to build web platforms for clients. Next MDX Remote is perfect for projects that need scalable markdown content but don't need a robust CMS. While it is in beta, I suggest you [try it out on your next project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote).

## Updating MDX Code Blocks

Last year when I redesigned my website, I used [`rehype-prism-plus`](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus). This year I discovered [`rehype-pretty-code`](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/) and implemented [Railly Hugo's One Hunter Vercel Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RaillyHugo.one-hunter) with a custom background.

One of my favorite features of rehype-pretty-code is that you can highlight inline code like so: `const age = 25 {:js}`.

I still have a custom `Pre` component that allows readers to copy a code block to their clipboard, which you can try out below!

<CodeTitle title="components/emoji.tsx" lang="tsx" />

```tsx {9-16} showLineNumbers
// You can copy this code block
interface EmojiProps {
  label?: string;
  emoji: string;
}
// Note the highlighted rows below
export default function Emoji({ label, emoji, ...props }: EmojiProps) {
  return (
    <span
      role="img"
      aria-label={label || ""}
      aria-hidden={label ? "false" : "true"}
      {...props}
    >
      {emoji}
    </span>
  );
}
```

## Tailwind Merge

To be able to create usable components without style conflicts, I am using [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) and [`tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge). You can do the same with your Tailwind CSS projects by creating a function as follows:

<CodeTitle title="utils/clsxm.ts" lang="ts" />

```ts
import clsx, { ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";
// Merge classes with tailwind-merge with clsx full feature
export function clsxm(...classes: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(...classes));
}
```

## Skeleton Component

This year, I created a custom skeleton component. This is useful when you want to show a user that data is not yet available but loading. I wrote this component out as :

<CodeTitle title="components/skeleton.tsx" lang="tsx" />

```tsx import React from "react"; import {clsxm} from "utils";
interface ISkeleton extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {}

export default function Skeleton({ className, ...props }: ISkeleton) {
  return (
    <div className={clsxm("animate-pulse bg-gray-200", className)} {...props} />
  );
```

## Summary

As I go into 2023, I am still using the same web technologies I was building with last year. I look forward to further expanding my design and React development knowledge this year.
