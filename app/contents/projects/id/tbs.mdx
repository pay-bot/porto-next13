This project was built using React.js, Tailwindcss, and Material UI.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

This website places a strong emphasis on UI/UX, and it contains a large amount of data. I used Tailwind CSS to solve the UI/UX part, as its flexibility allows for easy handling of complex designs. In addition, I utilized Redux to manage state and pass it to other components.
