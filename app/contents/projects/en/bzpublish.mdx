> ## How BZ PUblish Work ?

### Client Templating

For the first step, each client is provided with one website template. This template is used to collect client data and information. Automation will also create storage in Azure storage based on each client's template. In this part, the admin also sets up the subscription module and site domain.

### Site Structure Setup

The site structure contains a client's sitemap. The frontend will create all pages based on the sitemap.

### Section Templating

In this part, the frontend will create all sections for each page based on the design. The frontend will use the BZ Publish CMS Module to fill the content and consume the content using an API. Clients can add an unlimited number of sections to any page they want.

- **Article** for save article collection
- **Job Poster** for save Job Poster collection
- **Media** for save media collection
- **Text** for save Text collection
- **Table** for generate Table and Chart data

### Build website

the last step . actually this simple step , for build website admin just select build type , there are two options Preview and Publish, usually preview build the first, after all good with no bug, and then next build the publish

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

This is my biggest project with a lot of new technologies for me.

BZ Publish system was designed for can manage various clients needs. like multiple role access, multiple site, multiple language, and many more. but always be chalanging for me is handling multiple language, every CRUD Proses i should create form with function for handle this case. i learn a lot from this. every day during i working this project always fight with form validation, handling array, handling http request. very intresting fight for me .
